## üìã Pre-Push Verification

Before committing, verify:

- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and is complete
- [x] All jobs have `needs: detect-branch`
- [x] Branch detection job outputs are correct
- [x] Push trigger includes `'**'` for all branches
- [x] Cache configuration in `.bazelrc` is present
- [x] Tools directory has BUILD.bazel and workspace_status.sh
- [x] No YAML syntax errors
- [x] All documentation files are created

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Files
```bash
# Check critical files exist
test -f .github/workflows/ci.yml && echo "‚úì Workflow exists"
test -f .bazelrc && echo "‚úì Bazelrc exists"
test -f tools/BUILD.bazel && echo "‚úì Tools BUILD exists"
test -f tools/workspace_status.sh && echo "‚úì Workspace status script exists"
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml \
        .bazelrc \
        tools/ \
        .bazelrc.local.template \
        .github/*.md \
        CI_*.md \
        verify-ci-setup.sh

git commit -m "ci: add GitHub Actions pipeline with branch detection and Bazel caching

- Add CI/CD workflow with 4 parallel jobs (build, coverage, lint, security)
- Implement branch detection (main/develop/feature)
- Extend pipeline to run on all branches via push
- Configure intelligent Bazel caching for faster builds
- Add comprehensive documentation for developers
- Include verification script for setup validation"
```

### Step 3: Push to Repository
```bash
# Push to main
git push origin main

# Or create a PR first to test
git push origin feature/ci-setup
# Then create PR via GitHub UI
```

### Step 4: Verify in GitHub Actions
1. Go to repository **Actions** tab
2. See "CI Pipeline" workflow running
3. Wait for completion (2-5 min first time)
4. Verify all 4 jobs passed
5. Check logs for branch detection output

### Step 5: Test Caching (Second Run)
1. Make a small change to any file
2. Push again
3. Check Actions tab
4. Second build should be 30-60 seconds
5. Look for "Cache hit" in restore step

---

## üîç What to Look For

### Successful First Run
```
‚úì detect-branch job completes
‚úì All 4 jobs run in parallel
‚úì Build completes in 2-5 minutes
‚úì All tests pass
‚úì No errors in logs
```

### Successful Second Run
```
‚úì Cache restore shows "Cache hit"
‚úì Build completes in 30-60 seconds
‚úì Same test results
‚úì Coverage reports generated
‚úì Linting passes
‚úì Security scan completes
```

### Branch Detection Output
```
üîç Branch Detection Results
Branch Type: feature
Branch Name: your-feature-branch
Is Main: false

OR

üîç Branch Detection Results
Branch Type: main
Branch Name: main
Is Main: true
```

## üìä Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| First build time | 2-5 min | ‚úÖ Expected |
| Cached build time | 30-60 sec | ‚úÖ Expected |
| No-change build | 15-20 sec | ‚úÖ Expected |
| Job parallelism | All 4 jobs | ‚úÖ Configured |
| Cache hit rate | 80%+ | ‚úÖ Expected |

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pipeline doesn't trigger on push
**Solution:** 
- Verify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is in main branch
- Wait 5-10 seconds and refresh Actions tab
- Check if workflow file has YAML syntax errors

### Issue: Branch detection shows "unknown"
**Solution:**
- Branch detection uses `${{ github.ref }}` 
- This should be `refs/heads/branch-name`
- Check GitHub Actions logs for actual value

### Issue: Cache not being used
**Solution:**
- First run won't have cache (expected)
- Verify MODULE.bazel, MODULE.bazel.lock, go.mod unchanged
- Check "Restore Bazel cache" step shows cache key

### Issue: Tests fail in CI but pass locally
**Solution:**
- Try running with same cache: `bazel test //... --disk_cache=~/.bazel-cache`
- Check .bazelrc for platform-specific settings
- Verify Go 1.25 installed locally
